	The "netdiscover –r 192.168.111.0/24" command discovers all IP addresses in the given range.

	    NMAP:
        	"nmap -sS [target IP address]" Scans all ports for the IP. Uses stealthy tcp, does not complete handshake.
	        "nmap -sV -O [target IP address]" Not stealthy, returns version and operating system.

        	dcfldd if=/dev/sda hash=md5 of=/media/diskimage.dd bs=512 conv=noerror

	            	if=/dev/sda is the input device, in this case /dev/sda.
            		hash=md5 tells the command to calculate an MD5 hash of the image that we can use to assure the image integrity.
        	    	of=/media/diskimage.dd is the file that the disk image with go, in this case on an external device mounted at /media.
	            	bs=512 tells the command we want to transfer the image 512 bytes at a time.
            		noerror tells the command that in the case of error continue to do the data transfer, but write zeros where the error occur.
